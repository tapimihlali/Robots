The user wants a workflow for their trading bots, from optimization to live trading. I'll outline a six-step process:

1. Single Symbol Backtesting: Validate the strategy on individual symbols, using --plot for visualization.
2. Optimization: Tune parameters for promising symbols.
3. Walk-Forward Optimization: Crucially, check parameter robustness against unseen data.
4. Portfolio Backtesting: Evaluate overall strategy performance and diversification across multiple symbols.
5. Demo Account Live Trading: Test in real-time market conditions without financial risk.
6. Live Trading: Deploy with real capital only after thorough demo validation.
